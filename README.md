## DocGPT- A medical chatbot

DocGPT is a robust web application tailored for the medical industry, equipped with tons of features. Its primary function is to address user queries, particularly those pertaining to medical concerns or patient ailments.
\
\
With its advanced capabilities, DocGPT efficiently processes and responds to user inquiries. One of DocGPTâ€™s standout features is its memory, which retains past conversations between users and the system. This enables it to provide more personalized and contextually relevant responses by considering previous interactions. Additionally, DocGPT allows users to seamlessly navigate through previous conversations and even continue them if desired.
\
\
 This feature enhances user
experience and streamlines communication. Users also have the option to augment the existing database of medical documents by adding their own data or create entirely new databases tailored to their specific needs. Furthermore, DocGPT offers functionalities
such as speech-to-text input and text-to-speech output, catering to users who require alternative means of interaction. In summary, DocGPT is a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate medical inquiries and streamline communication between users and the system, offering advanced features for enhanced usability and effectiveness.

## Implementation

To present this medical question-answering model to the end user, I have developed a web application. The front end of the website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface. The front end allows users to input their queries and interact with the system seamlessly.
On the backend, I implemented the application using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Flask handles the incoming requests from the web server and interacts with
the Llama 2 model and the MongoDB database to process and retrieve the relevant information. \
\
The backend Python code includes functions to connect to the MongoDB server, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database, and manage the data retrieval process. When a user submits a query through the web interface, Flask uses
these functions to retrieve the relevant information from the database and pass it to the Llama 2 model for processing.
